### Hypothesis Testing
[百科词条-假设检验](https://baike.baidu.com/item/假设检验)
1) null-hypothesis H0 - 原假设
    We can't prove this hypothesis is true, we can only reject it's true (prove it's false) 
2) alternative-hypothesis HA/H1 - 备选假设

Sample
H0: Most dogs have four legs (Most = more than 50%)
Ha: Most dogs have less than four legs
Testing 1: Sample 10 dogs and find that all have 4 legs... 
Which still didn't prove H0, but fail to reject the null hypothesis

Testing 2: Sample 10 dogs and find that 6 dogs have 3 legs... 
Which is successfully rejecting H0.
