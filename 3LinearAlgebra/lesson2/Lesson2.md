## 7. Inner Products

v * w = ||v|| * ||w|| * cos0
v * w = v1 * w1 + v2 * w2 + v3 * w3

Angle 0 = arccos(v * w / ||v|| * ||w||)

-1 <= cos0 <= 1
|v * w| <= ||v|| * ||w||


## Parallel and Orthogonal Vectors

V and W are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other,
 i.e. V is parallel to 2 * V, 1/2 * V, -V, 0 * V, V

V and W are orthogonal if V*W = 0.
0 is parallel and orthogonal to all vectors
0 is the only vector orthogonal to itself
